      <p>When designing digital services it can be difficult to understand the accessibility challenges that effect people. The purpose of this workshop is to look at what is meant by accessibility, and to use the concept of permenant, temporary, and situational challenges as a method to increase participants awareness of accessibility issues. The workshop then leads on to look more specifically at challenges that effect people for a given technology platform and finishes with participants developing an understanding of the current problem areas that exist when developing accessible products.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this workshop is to highlight the different accessibility challenges that exist when creating digital services. Digital services are varied, and include web applications; mobile apps; desktop software packages; video games; and more. The workshop is split into three different activities and features a mixture of tasks based on individual, team (3-4 people), and group (2-3 team) activities.</p>

      <h2>Workshop Description</h2>
      <p>The workshop begins with a brief introduction to a practical model of different accessibility challenge areas. These focus on visual, cognitive, physical, communication, emotional and intersectional considerations.</p>

      <h3>Activity 1</h3>
      <p>The first activity in the workshop allows participants to broaden their current understanding of what constitutes an accessibility challenge. This is done through evaluating accessibility issues in terms of those that are permanent, those
        that are temporary, and those that are situational.</p>

      <h3>Activity 2</h3>
      <p>The second activity is designed to encourage participants to explore their current awareness of accessibility issues and what methods can be employed to solve them. These methods might include education, policy changes, or the development
        of technical tools.</p>

      <h3>Activity 3</h3>
      <p>In the third activity, individual teams are asked to pick one of the six accessibility challenge areas they have identified to analyse more deeply. At this stage teams begin by evaluating their previous matrixes and are then asked to pick
        three activities related to an individual research challenge area.</p>
