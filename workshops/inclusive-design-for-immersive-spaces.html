      <p>When developing workspaces it is important to focus on factors surrounding people, context, and the environment. While factors that help or hinder task completion are commonly considered, factors associated with technology-based challenges are normally considered only as an afterthought. In the context of developing workspaces, there are also intangible aspects that need to be taken into consideration.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this workshop is to develop an understanding of how technology can be used to inform processes of designing Immersive Environments.</p>

      <h2>Workshop Description</h2>
      <p>The workshop begins with a brief introduction to a practical model of different accessibility challenge areas. These focus on visual, cognitive, physical, communication, emotional and intersectional considerations.</p>

      <h3>Activity 1</h3>
      <p>The first activity in the workshop allows participants to broaden their current understanding of what constitutes an accessibility challenge. This is done through evaluating accessibility issues in terms of those that are permanent, those
        that are temporary, and those that are situational.</p>

      <h3>Activity 2</h3>
      <p>The second activity is designed to encourage participants to explore their current awareness of accessibility issues and what methods can be employed to solve them. These methods might include education, policy changes, or the development
        of technical tools.</p>

      <h3>Activity 3</h3>
      <p>In the third activity, individual teams are asked to pick one of the six accessibility challenge areas they have identified to analyse more deeply. At this stage teams begin by evaluating their previous matrixes and are then asked to pick
        three activities related to an individual research challenge area.</p>
