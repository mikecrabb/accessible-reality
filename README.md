# Accessible Reality

Accessible Reality is a project that is run by Dr Michael Crabb and Dr Michael Heron. The purpose of this work is to create high quality accessible design workshops that can be used by all.

Currently, the following workshops are available for individuals to use:
- **Designing for Accessibility I** - A workshop that uses the concepts of permanent, temporary, and situational accessibility issues to increase overall understanding with participants.
- **Accessible Design for Pirates** - A workshop that introduces concepts of accessible design by examining the accessibility challenges that are faced by a modern day pirate.
