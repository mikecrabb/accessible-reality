      <h1>About <small class="text-muted">Accessible Reality</small></h1>
      <p>The <strong>Accessible Reality</strong> project started in 2016 when <a href="http://www.mikecrabb.co.uk">Michael Crabb</a> and <a href="http://meeplelikeus.co.uk/">Michael Heron</a> were searching for new ways to teach accessibility
        principles within the Computer Science curriculum. Unable to find something that fitted their needs, and with an interest in accessible development in general, they started Accessible Reality. The aim of this was to create workshops that
        could be downloaded and used by anyone with an interest in accessible development.</p>

      <p>2017 saw the project being picked up by <a href="http://www.sicsa.ac.uk">SICSA</a> as part of a short theme into the <strong>Future of Games Accessibility</strong>. The audience for the workshops grew and they began looking for more ways to
        understand how designers and devlopers create accessible products and began taking their workshop outside of the CS classroom and into local industry. 2017 also saw the development of a new workshop aimed at promoting accessible thinking
        within a non-specialist audience and the workshop on <a href="#">Creating an Accessible Pirate Ship</a> was created. This one has proved to be a slow burn but is a winner for outreach activities and non-specialist industry events.</p>

        <h2>Our Process</h2>
        <p>All of our workshops go through several phases of development. This starts with the generation of workshop ideas and goes through a number of steps finishing with the sharing of workshop themes with the overall community. The steps carried out are detailed below:</p>
